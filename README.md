####Rules

You may only place discs if that would cause your discs to flank a series of one
or more of your opponents discs - so that there is one or more pieces of the
opposite color in a straight line between the new piece and one of your existing
pieces.

When neither player can move, the game ends. The player with the most pieces on the board wins!
